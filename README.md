1. Event Binding: One-way data binding, in which information is sent from a component’s template to the component’s class
2. @HostListener: Angular decorator that handles events on the host element
3. Renderer2: Using Renderer2 .listen() method for a target event and element
4. RxJS: Using RxJS .fromEvent() operator that turns events into observable sequences
```
